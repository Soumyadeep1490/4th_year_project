    we need to multily the X0 term with (1 / ‚àö2) and then multiply the

    two-dimensional DCT-II of an image or a matrix is simply the
    one-dimensional DCT-II, from above, performed along the rows and then along
    the columns (or vice versa)

    as this is a 2D implementation it'll work only in one color channel
    so to get a dct transformation on a RGB image we have to call this function
    3 times with each of the 3 channels
